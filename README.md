# Get to know the types of Cryptography
> Cryptography is the study of the techniques to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data  through methods and algorithms

## There are several types of cryptography that are often used, including:

### Classical Cryptography

#### Caesar Substitution
1. Shift Caesar
    >  This is the basic type of Caesar Substitution, where where each letter in the password is replaced with letter located N positions farther away in the alphabet.

2. Shift Caesar Reverse
     >  In this variation, instead of swiping the letter in front, we spell out the letters behind in the alphabet

3. Shift Caesar Double
     >  In this method, two locks are used, where two shifts are applied to the message, usually with using different locks.

4. Shift Caesar Random
     >   Caesarean Substitution with Random Substitution is a variant of the Caesarean temple in which instead of substituting each letter with a fixed shift (e.g., +3 or +5), each letter is substituted with another letter that is determined by a substitution key that is generated in a random manner.
